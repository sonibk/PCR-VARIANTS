## REAL TIME PCR
### Principle
+ Real-time PCR is accomplished in the same manner as conventional PCR-based assays (denaturation of double-stranded DNA followed by primer annealing and extension).  + + However, it is the detection process that discriminates real-time PCR from conventional PCR assays.
+ In real-time PCR assays, accumulation of amplicon is monitored as it is generated using labelling of primers with dyes capable of fluorescence. These labels produce a change in fluorescent signal that is measured by the instrument following their direct interaction with or hybridization to the amplicon. This signal is related to the amount of amplified product present during each cycle and increases as the number of specific amplicon increases.
+ The probe is labelled with two fluorescent moieties, the reporter (fluorophore) is attached to the probe’s 5’ end and the quencher is attached to its 3’ end.  
#### Taqman Probe

+ It is a hydrolysis probe which bear a reporter dye, often fluorescein (FAM) at its 5’ end and a quencher tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), attached to the 3’ end of the oligonucleotide.
+ Unders normal conditions, the probe remain coiled on itself bringing the fluorescence dye near the quencher, which inhibits or quenches of fluorescent signal of the dye.
+ The oligonucleotide of the Taqpolymerase has a homologous region with the target gene and thus when the target sequence is present in the mixture, it bind with the sample DNA.
+ As the taqpolymerase start to sunthesize new DNA strand in the extension stage, it causes degradation of the probe by 5’ end nuclease activity and the fluorescein is separated from the quencher as a result of which fluorescence signal is generated.
+ As this procedure continues, in each cycle the number of signal molecule increases, causing the increase in fluorescence which is positively related with the amplification of the target.
##### Advatages
+ It gives a look in to the reaction that is help to decide which reactions have worked well and which have failed.
+ The efficiency of the reaction can be precisely calculated.
+ There is no need to run the PCR product out on a gel after the reaction as the melt curve analysis serve the purpose.
+ The real-time PCR data can be used to perform truly quantitative analysis of gene expression. In comparison, old fashioned PCR was only ever semi-quantitative at best.
+ Faster than normal PCR.
